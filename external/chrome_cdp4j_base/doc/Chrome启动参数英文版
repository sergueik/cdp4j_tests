--/prefetch:1	/prefetch:# arguments to use when launching various process types. It has been observed that when file reads are consistent for 3 process launches with the same /prefetch:# argument, the Windows prefetcher starts issuing reads in batch at process launch. Because reads depend on the process type, the prefetcher wouldn't be able to observe consistent reads if no /prefetch:# arguments were used. Note that the browser process has no /prefetch:# argument; as such all other processes must have one in order to avoid polluting its profile. Note: # must always be in [1, 8]; otherwise it is ignored by the Windows prefetcher. 
--/prefetch:2	No description 
--/prefetch:3	No description 
--/prefetch:4	No description 
--/prefetch:5	/prefetch:# arguments for the browser process launched in background mode and for the watcher process. Use profiles 5, 6 and 7 as documented on kPrefetchArgument* in content_switches.cc. 
--/prefetch:6	No description 
--/prefetch:8	Prefetch arguments are used by the Windows prefetcher to disambiguate different execution modes (i.e. process types) of the same executable image so that different types of processes don't trample each others' prefetch behavior. Legal values are integers in the range [1, 8]. We reserve 8 to mean "whatever", and this will ultimately lead to processes with /prefetch:8 having inconsistent behavior thus disabling prefetch in practice. TODO(rockot): Make it possible for embedders to override this argument on a per-service basis.

--login-manager	Enables Chrome-as-a-login-manager behavior. 
--login-profile	Specifies the profile to use once a chromeos user is logged in. This parameter is ignored if user goes through login screen since user_id hash defines which profile directory to use. In case of browser restart within active session this parameter is used to pass user_id hash for primary user.

--mem-pressure-system-reserved-kb	Some platforms typically have very little 'free' memory, but plenty is available in buffers+cached. For such platforms, configure this amount as the portion of buffers+cached memory that should be treated as unavailable. If this switch is not used, a simple pressure heuristic based purely on free memory will be used.

--mute-audio	Mutes audio sent to the audio device so it is not audible during automated testing. 
--nacl-broker	Value for --type that causes the process to run as a NativeClient broker (used for launching NaCl loader processes on 64-bit Windows). 
--nacl-dangerous-no-sandbox-nonsfi	Disable sandbox even for non SFI mode. This is particularly unsafe as non SFI NaCl heavily relies on the seccomp sandbox. 
--nacl-debug-mask	Uses NaCl manifest URL to choose whether NaCl program will be debugged by debug stub. Switch value format: [!]pattern1,pattern2,...,patternN. Each pattern uses the same syntax as patterns in Chrome extension manifest. The only difference is that * scheme matches all schemes instead of matching only http and https. If the value doesn't start with !, a program will be debugged if manifest URL matches any pattern. If the value starts with !, a program will be debugged if manifest URL does not match any pattern. 
--nacl-gdb	Native Client GDB debugger that will be launched automatically when needed. 
--nacl-gdb-script	GDB script to pass to the nacl-gdb debugger at startup. 
--nacl-loader	Value for --type that causes the process to run as a NativeClient loader for SFI mode.

--need-arc-migration-policy-check	If present, the device needs to check the policy to see if the migration to ext4 for ARC is allowed. It should be present only on devices that have been initially issued with ecrypfs encryption and have ARC (N+) available. For the devices in other categories this flag must be missing. 
--net-log-capture-mode	Sets the granularity of events to capture in the network log. The mode can be set to one of the following values: "Default" "IncludeCookiesAndCredentials" "IncludeSocketBytes" See the functions of the corresponding name in net_log_capture_mode.h for a description of their meaning.

--no-default-browser-check	Disables the default browser check. Useful for UI/browser tests where we want to avoid having the default browser info-bar displayed. 
--no-experiments	Disables all experiments set on about:flags. Does not disable about:flags itself. Useful if an experiment makes chrome crash at startup: One can start chrome with --no-experiments, disable the problematic lab at about:flags and then restart chrome without this switch again. 
--no-first-run	Skip First Run tasks, whether or not it's actually the First Run. Overridden by kForceFirstRun. This does not drop the First Run sentinel and thus doesn't prevent first run from occuring the next time chrome is launched without this flag.

--no-referrers	Don't send HTTP-Referer headers. 
--no-sandbox	Disables the sandbox for all process types that are normally sandboxed. 
--no-service-autorun	Disables the service process from adding itself as an autorun process. This does not delete existing autorun registrations, it just prevents the service from registering a new one. 
--no-session-id	No description 
--no-startup-window	Does not automatically open a browser window on startup (used when launching Chrome for the purpose of hosting background apps). 
--no-user-gesture-required	Autoplay policy that does not require any user gesture. 
--no-wifi	Disable features that require WiFi management. 
--no-zygote	Disables the use of a zygote process for forking child processes. Instead, child processes will be forked and exec'd directly. Note that --no-sandbox should also be used together with this flag because the sandbox needs the zygote to work. 
--noerrdialogs	Suppresses all error dialogs when present.

--overscroll-history-navigation	Controls the behavior of history navigation in response to horizontal overscroll. Set the value to '0' to disable. Set the value to '1' to enable the behavior where pages slide in and out in response to the horizontal overscroll gesture and a screenshot of the target page is shown. Set the value to '2' to enable the simplified overscroll UI where a navigation arrow slides in from the side of the screen in response to the horizontal overscroll gesture. Defaults to '1'. 
--overscroll-start-threshold	Controls the value of the threshold to start horizontal overscroll relative to the default value. E.g. set the value to '133' to have the overscroll start threshold be 133% of the default threshold.

'forcealltrue' to force the value on all nodes. 
--password-store[9]	Specifies which encryption storage backend to use. Possible values are kwallet, kwallet5, gnome, gnome-keyring, gnome-libsecret, basic. Any other value will lead to Chrome detecting the best backend automatically. TODO(crbug.com/571003): Once PasswordStore no longer uses the Keyring or KWallet for storing passwords, rename this flag to stop referencing passwords. Do not rename it sooner, though; developers and testers might rely on it keeping large amounts of testing passwords out of their Keyrings or KWallets. 
--permission-request-api-scope	Development flag for permission request API. This flag is needed until the API is finalized. TODO(bauerb): Remove when this flag is not needed anymore. 
--permission-request-api-url	Development flag for permission request API. This flag is needed until the API is finalized. TODO(bauerb): Remove when this flag is not needed anymore.

--print-to-pdf	Save a pdf file of the loaded page. 
--privet-ipv6-only	Use IPv6 only for privet HTTP. 
--process-per-site	Enable the "Process Per Site" process model for all domains. This mode consolidates same-site pages so that they share a single process. More details here: - http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models - The class comment in site_instance.h, listing the supported process models. IMPORTANT: This isn't to be confused with --site-per-process (which is about isolation, not consolidation). You probably want the other one. 
--process-per-tab	Runs each set of script-connected tabs (i.e., a BrowsingInstance) in its own renderer process. We default to using a renderer process for each site instance (i.e., group of pages from the same registered domain with script connections to each other). TODO(creis): This flag is currently a no-op. We should refactor it to avoid "unnecessary" process swaps for cross-site navigations but still swap when needed for security (e.g., isolated origins). 
--product-version	Outputs the product version information and quit. Used as an internal api to detect the installed version of Chrome on Linux. 
--profile-directory	Selects directory of profile to associate with the first browser launched. 
--profiler-timing	Configure whether chrome://profiler will contain timing information. This option is enabled by default. A value of "0" will disable profiler timing, while all other values will enable it.

--profiling-file	Specifies a location for profiling output. This will only work if chrome has been built with the gyp variable profiling=1 or gn arg enable_profiling=true. {pid} if present will be replaced by the pid of the process. {count} if present will be incremented each time a profile is generated for this process. The default is chrome-profile-{pid} for the browser and test-profile-{pid} for tests. 
--profiling-flush	Controls whether profile data is periodically flushed to a file. Normally the data gets written on exit but cases exist where chrome doesn't exit cleanly (especially when using single-process). A time in seconds can be specified. 
--progress-bar-animation[6]	Specifies Android phone page loading progress bar animation. 
--progress-bar-completion[6]	When blink should declare a load "done" for the purpose of the progress bar.

--register-pepper-plugins	Register Pepper plugins (see pepper_plugin_list.cc for its format). 
--relauncher[7]	A process type (switches::kProcessType) that relaunches the browser. See chrome/browser/mac/relauncher.h. 
--remote-debugging-address	Use the given address instead of the default loopback for accepting remote debugging connections. Should be used together with --remote-debugging-port. Note that the remote debugging protocol does not perform any authentication, so exposing it too widely can be a security risk. 
--remote-debugging-port	Enables remote debug over HTTP on the specified port. 
--remote-debugging-socket-fd	The given value is the fd of a socket already opened by the parent process. This allows automation to provide a listening socket for clients to connect to before chrome is fully fired up. In particular, a parent process can open the port, exec headles chrome, and connect to the devtools port immediately. Waiting for chrome to be ready is then handled by the first read from the port, which will block until chrome is ready. No polling is needed. 
--remote-debugging-socket-name[6]	Enables remote debug over HTTP on the specified socket name. 
--remote-debugging-targets	Porvides a list of addresses to discover DevTools remote debugging targets. The format is <host>:<port>,...,<host>:port.

--renderer-cmd-prefix	The contents of this flag are prepended to the renderer command line. Useful values might be "valgrind" or "xterm -e gdb --args". 
--renderer-process-limit	Overrides the default/calculated limit to the number of renderer processes. Very high values for this setting can lead to high memory/resource usage or instability. 
--renderer-startup-dialog	Causes the renderer process to display a dialog on launch. Passing this flag also adds kNoSandbox on Windows non-official builds, since that's needed to show a dialog. 
--renderer-wait-for-java-debugger[6]	Block ChildProcessMain thread of the renderer's ChildProcessService until a Java debugger is attached. 
--renderpass	No description 
--repl	Runs a read-eval-print loop that allows the user to evaluate Javascript expressions. 
--report-vp9-as-an-unsupported-mime-type	Force to report VP9 as an unsupported MIME type. 
--require-audio-hardware-for-testing	When running tests on a system without the required hardware or libraries, this flag will cause the tests to fail. Otherwise, they silently succeed. 
--reset-app-list-install-state	If set, the app list will forget it has been installed on startup. Note this doesn't prevent the app list from running, it just makes Chrome think the app list hasn't been enabled (as in kEnableAppList) yet. 
--reset-variation-state	Forces a reset of the one-time-randomized FieldTrials on this client, also known as the Chrome Variations state. 
--restore-last-session	Indicates the last session should be restored on startup. This overrides the preferences value. Note that this does not force automatic session restore following a crash, so as to prevent a crash loop. This switch is used to implement support for OS-specific "continue where you left off" functionality on OS X and Windows. 
--root-layer-scrolls	Handles frame scrolls via the root RenderLayer instead of the FrameView. 
--rtl	No description 
--run-all-compositor-stages-before-draw	Effectively disables pipelining of compositor frame production stages by waiting for each stage to finish before completing a frame.

--safebrowsing-disable-download-protection	TODO(lzheng): Remove this flag once the feature works fine (http://crbug.com/74848). Disables safebrowsing feature that checks download url and downloads content's hash to make sure the content are not malicious. 
--safebrowsing-disable-extension-blacklist	Disables safebrowsing feature that checks for blacklisted extensions. 
--safebrowsing-manual-download-blacklist	List of comma-separated sha256 hashes of executable files which the download-protection service should treat as "dangerous." For a file to show a warning, it also must be considered a dangerous filetype and not be whitelisted otherwise (by signature or URL) and must be on a supported OS. Hashes are in hex. This is used for manual testing when looking for ways to by-pass download protection. 
--SafeSites	No description 
--sandbox-ipc	Causes the process to run as a sandbox IPC subprocess. 
--save-page-as-mhtml	Disable saving pages as HTML-only, disable saving pages as HTML Complete (with a directory of sub-resources). Enable only saving pages as MHTML. See http://crbug.com/120416 for how to remove this switch. 
--screen-config	Specifies the initial screen configuration, or state of all displays, for FakeDisplayDelegate, see class for format details. 
--screenshot	Save a screenshot of the loaded page. 
--scripts-require-action	Notify the user and require consent for extensions running scripts. Appending --scripts-require-action=1 has the same effect as --enable-scripts-require-action (see below).

--secondary	No description 
--secondary-display-layout	Specifies the layout mode and offsets for the secondary display for testing. The format is "<t|r|b|l>,<offset>" where t=TOP, r=RIGHT, b=BOTTOM and L=LEFT. For example, 'r,-100' means the secondary display is positioned on the right with -100 offset. (above than primary) 
--secondary-ui-md	Applies the material design mode passed via --top-chrome-md to elements throughout Chrome (not just top Chrome). 
--service	The process type value which causes a process to run as a cloud print service process. DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE. Cloud printing relies on an external binary launching Chrome with this process type. 
--service-manager	The value of the |kProcessType| switch which tells the executable to assume the role of a standalone Service Manager instance. 
--service-name	Specified on the command line of service processes to indicate which service should be run. Useful when the service process binary may act as one of many different embedded services. 
--service-pipe-token	Provides a child process with a token string they can exchange for a message pipe whose other end is bound to a service_manager::Service binding in the Service Manager. 
--service-request-channel-token	The token to use to construct the message pipe for a service in a child process. 
--service-runner	The value of the |kProcessType| switch which tells the executable to assume the role of a service instance.

--site-per-process	Enforces a one-site-per-process security policy: * Each renderer process, for its whole lifetime, is dedicated to rendering pages for just one site. * Thus, pages from different sites are never in the same process. * A renderer process's access rights are restricted based on its site. * All cross-site navigations force process swaps. * <iframe>s are rendered out-of-process whenever the src= is cross-site. More details here: - http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/site-isolation - http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models - The class comment in site_instance.h, listing the supported process models. IMPORTANT: this isn't to be confused with --process-per-site (which is about process consolidation, not isolation). You probably want this one. 
--skip-gpu-data-loading	Skip gpu info collection, blacklist loading, and blacklist auto-update scheduling at browser startup time.

--trace-config-file	Causes TRACE_EVENT flags to be recorded from startup. This flag will be ignored if --trace-startup or --trace-shutdown is provided. 
--trace-export-events-to-etw	Enables the exporting of the tracing events to ETW. This is only supported on Windows Vista and later. 
--trace-shutdown	Causes TRACE_EVENT flags to be recorded beginning with shutdown. Optionally, can specify the specific trace categories to include (e.g. --trace-shutdown=base,net) otherwise, all events are recorded. --trace-shutdown-file can be used to control where the trace log gets stored to since there is otherwise no way to access the result. 
--trace-shutdown-file	If supplied, sets the file which shutdown tracing will be stored into, if omitted the default will be used "chrometrace.log" in the current directory. Has no effect unless --trace-shutdown is also supplied. Example: --trace-shutdown --trace-shutdown-file=/tmp/trace_event.log 
--trace-startup	Causes TRACE_EVENT flags to be recorded from startup. Optionally, can specify the specific trace categories to include (e.g. --trace-startup=base,net) otherwise, all events are recorded. Setting this flag results in the first call to BeginTracing() to receive all trace events since startup. In Chrome, you may find --trace-startup-file and --trace-startup-duration to control the auto-saving of the trace (not supported in the base-only TraceLog component). 
--trace-startup-duration	Sets the time in seconds until startup tracing ends. If omitted a default of 5 seconds is used. Has no effect without --trace-startup, or if --startup-trace-file=none was supplied. 
--trace-startup-file	If supplied, sets the file which startup tracing will be stored into, if omitted the default will be used "chrometrace.log" in the current directory. Has no effect unless --trace-startup is also supplied. Example: --trace-startup --trace-startup-file=/tmp/trace_event.log As a special case, can be set to 'none' - this disables automatically saving the result to a file and the first manually recorded trace will then receive all events since startup. 
--trace-to-console	Sends a pretty-printed version of tracing info to the console. 
--trace-to-file	Sends trace events from these categories to a file. --trace-to-file on its own sends to default categories.

--try-supported-channel-layouts	Instead of always using the hardware channel layout, check if a driver supports the source channel layout. Avoids outputting empty channels and permits drivers to enable stereo to multichannel expansion. Kept behind a flag since some drivers lie about supported layouts and hang when used. See http://crbug.com/259165 for more details. 
--type	Indicates the type of process to run. This may be "service-manager", "service-runner", or any other arbitrary value supported by the embedder.

--unlimited-storage	Overrides per-origin quota settings to unlimited storage for any apps/origins. This should be used only for testing purpose. 
--unsafe-pac-url	Pass the full https:// URL to PAC (Proxy Auto Config) scripts. As opposed to the default behavior which strips path and query components before passing to the PAC scripts. 
--unsafely-allow-protected-media-identifier-for-domain	For automated testing of protected content, this switch allows specific domains (e.g. example.com) to skip asking the user for permission to share the protected media identifier. In this context, domain does not include the port number. User's content settings will not be affected by enabling this switch. Reference: http://crbug.com/718608 Example: --unsafely-allow-protected-media-identifier-for-domain=a.com,b.ca 
--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure	Treat given (insecure) origins as secure origins. Multiple origins can be supplied. Has no effect unless --user-data-dir is also supplied.

--use-file-for-fake-audio-capture	Play a .wav file as the microphone. Note that for WebRTC calls we'll treat the bits as if they came from the microphone, which means you should disable audio processing (lest your audio file will play back distorted). The input file is converted to suit Chrome's audio buses if necessary, so most sane .wav files should work. You can pass either <path> to play the file looping or <path>%noloop to stop after playing the file to completion. 
--use-file-for-fake-video-capture	Use an .y4m file to play as the webcam. See the comments in media/capture/video/file_video_capture_device.h for more details. 
--use-first-display-as-internal	Uses the 1st display in --ash-host-window-bounds as internal display. This is for debugging on linux desktop.

--v2-sandbox[7]	Enable the V2 sandbox during the helper executable initialization. 
--v2-sandbox-enabled[7]	The command line paramter indicating that the v2 sandbox is enabled. This must be different than the "v2-sandbox" flag to avoid endless re-executing. The flag tells the sandbox initialization code inside Chrome that the sandbox should already be enabled. TODO(kerrnel): Remove this once the V2 sandbox migration is complete, as processes will be assumed to run under the V2 sandbox. 
--v8-cache-options	Set options to cache V8 data. (off, preparse data, or code) 
--v8-cache-strategies-for-cache-storage	Set strategies to cache V8 data in CacheStorage. (off, normal, or aggressive)

Additionally, unlike chrome://translate-internals, the value isn't persisted across sessions. 
--variations-server-url	Specifies a custom URL for the server which reports variation data to the client. Specifying this switch enables the Variations service on unofficial builds. See variations_service.cc.

--video-threads	Set number of threads to use for video decoding. 
--video-underflow-threshold-ms	Allows clients to override the threshold for when the media renderer will declare the underflow state for the video stream when audio is present. TODO(dalecurtis): Remove once experiments for http://crbug.com/470940 finish. 
--virtual-time-budget	If set the system waits the specified number of virtual milliseconds before deeming the page to be ready. For determinism virtual time does not advance while there are pending network fetches (i.e no timers will fire). Once all network fetches have completed, timers fire and if the system runs out of virtual time is fastforwarded so the next timer fires immediatley, until the specified virtual time budget is exhausted. 
--vmodule	Gives the per-module maximal V-logging levels to override the value given by --v. E.g. "my_module=2,foo*=3" would change the logging level for all code in source files "my_module.*" and "foo*.*" ("-inl" suffixes are also disregarded for this matching). Any pattern containing a forward or backward slash will be tested against the whole pathname and not just the module. E.g., "*/foo/bar/*=2" would change the logging level for all code in source files under a "foo/bar" directory.
